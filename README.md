## What is TerrierMap?

TerrierMap is a web application that allows students, faculty, and staff at Boston University to quickly and easily navigate their unique campus. Classes and events are always taking place on campus, where most of the time the location is shared in a three letter building code followed by the room number. 

For example, a student may have a class located at CAS. With that information, they would need to search for the name of the building with the code CAS and would learn that it is the College of Arts and Sciences. With that information, they could then search the buildings name on a map and determine it's location on the map. 


| Code |   | Building Name |   | Address |
